# MKU DSC WEB MONDAY CODE

Every single monday we do Web training at MKU.

- It is very practical
- very community driven

## Getting Started

To get started, just clone the whole folder:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/DSC-Mount-Kenya-University/Second-Week-Web.git

```

You can now read through the code and even run it

## Contribution

We would love the code to have as much explanation and examples as possible for future generations and aliens.

If you can help with anything, Feel free to `fork` the repo and raise a `PR`
